==============================================================================
Most end users would probably only need to update the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file 
and sometime probably the Wacom X driver as well to use the rich features that 
Wacom tablets offer.  The steps could be as simple as:

    $ su
    # cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak
    # gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf

then follow the step listed at http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/index_old.php/howto/x11
or "man wacom" if you don't have network access to add sections for Wacom device.

However, if you have a USB tablet which is newer than your running kernel, i.e., 
the tablet is not supported by your running kernel, or you are a developer who is 
willing to build the driver from the source, there are extra work waiting for you.

==============================================================================

PREREQUISITES:

In order to build the linuxwacom X and kernel drivers, several GNU utilities will
need to be present on your system. Distributions like Fedora provide a handy
"Development Tools" group that will bring in all the necessary software. In other
distributions, you may need to install the necessary packages individually. For
users of Solaris it is important to use the GNU versions of these utilities, e.g.
as installed from OpenCSW; the SUNW versions of these utilities are incompatible.

  * GCC4
  * GNU make
  * GNU sed
  * pkgconfig
  * GNU libtool  (Only required for builds from git)
  * GNU autoconf (Only required for builds from git)
  * GNU automake (Only required for builds from git)

Additionally, a number of development headers will need to be made available for
the drivers to compile. Some distributions (e.g. RHEL 5) provide these headers as
installable packages, while others (e.g. Solaris) may require you to locate
appropriate headers elsewhere.

  * RHEL 5:
      * xorg-x11-server-sdk
          * libXau-devel
          * xorg-x11-util-macros
          * xorg-x11-proto-devel
          * libXdmcp-devel
          * mesa-libGL-devel
          * libX11-devel
      * libXi-devel
      * kernel-devel

  * Other:
      * xorg-server [e.g. https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.2/src/xserver/xorg-server-X11R7.2-1.2.0.tar.bz2]
      * xproto      [e.g. https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.2/src/proto/xproto-X11R7.2-7.0.10.tar.bz2]
      * libX11      [e.g. https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.2/src/lib/libX11-X11R7.2-1.1.1.tar.bz2]
      * libXi       [e.g. https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.2/src/lib/libXi-X11R7.2-1.0.2.tar.bz2]

Other optional dependencies may also need to be installed in order to build some
pieces of software.

  * tcl  (Required for ????)
  * tk   (Required for ????)


BUILDING FROM SOURCE:

As you would expect, run configure and make. If building from git, it is necessary
to first run `./bootstrap` to generate the configure script. Configure options are
explained below.

    $ ./configure && make


CONFIGURE OPTIONS:

This file contains hints for building the sources.  There are a number of build
 targets, some of which are not built automatically.  Here is the
breakdown:

      wacom.o: not built by default (--enable-wacom, --disable-wacom)
      wacdump: built by default (--enable-wacdump, --disable-wacdump)
       xidump: built by default (--enable-xidump, --disable-xidump)
    xsetwacom: built by default (--enable-xsetwacom, --disable-xsetwacom)
        hid.o: not built by default (--enable-hid, --disable-hid;  Only kernels 2.6.18 or older need it.)
  wacom_drv.o: built by default (--enable-wacomdrv, --disable-wacomdrv)

There are many options, and configure will attempt to guess the correct
values for most of them.  By default, only wacomcpl, xsetwacom,  wacom_drv.o, 
xidump, and wacdump program are built.

Please surf the HOWTO page at http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/index_old.php/howto/main
(or the miniHOWTO at http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/index_old.php/minihowto if 
you run a Fedora system) to find the proper options if the default building 
environment doesn't work for you.

==============================================================================
Users who intend to build the driver for Solaris should be aware that this is a
minimally-tested configuration. The ability to build under Solaris may break
without warning. Additionally, it is highly recommended to use prerequisite
packages from the OpenCSW archive as these are also used by the developers.
