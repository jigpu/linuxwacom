linuxwacom OpenSolaris X11 input driver

DESCRIPTION
==============
This input driver provides X11 with the ability to interface with Wacom
tablets and touchscreens under OpenSolaris. Note that for tablets to
work properly under X11, a kernel driver (such as usbwcm) must also be
installed.


REQUIREMENTS
===============
This driver has been tested to compile and run on Solaris 10 05/09, but
should work with other versions as well. To build the driver, the following
packages will need to be installed from the Blastwave software archive:

 * gcc4
 * gmake
 * gsed
 * libtool
 * autoconf
 * automake
 * pkgconfig
 * tcl
 * tk

In addition to these packages, you will also require a copy of the 'usbwcm'
kernel headers, the X11 development headers, and a copy of the pkgconfig
files for x11 and xorg-server. All of these should have been distributed
alongside this driver.


ENVIRONMENT SETUP
====================
Before building the driver, the build environment must be set up so that
all programs and source files can be located. The kernel sources, X11
headers, and pkgconfig files should reside alongside the 'linuxwacom'
directory this README file is in. The directory structure should look
like the following:

 ./
 ./linuxwacom
 ./linuxwacom/AUTHORS
 ./linuxwacom/bootstrap
 ./linuxwacom/ChangeLog
     ....
 ./usbwcm
 ./usbwcm/headers
 ./usbwcm/headers/sys
 ./usbwcm/headers/sys/usb
     ....
 ./X11R7.2
 ./X11R7.2/include
 ./X11R7.2/include/GL
     ....
 ./x11.pc
 ./xorg-server.pc

From the parent directory, run the following commands:

	$ export PATH="$PATH:/opt/csw/bin:/opt/csw/gcc4/bin:/usr/ccs/bin"
	$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$(pwd)
	$ export PKG_CONFIG_TOP_BUILD_DIR=$(pwd)
	$ export CFLAGS="-I$(pwd)/usbwcm/headers -I$(pwd)/X11R7.2/include -I$(pwd)/X11R7.2/include/xorg -I."
	$ export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/csw/lib -R/opt/csw/lib"


BUILDING
===========
Once the build environment has been set up, cd into the 'linuxwacom' directory
and begin the build as follows:

	$ ./bootstrap
	$ ./configure --with-linux --with-tcl=/opt/csw/include --with-tk=/opt/csw/include --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib MAKE=gmake
	$ gmake


INSTALLING
=============
To install the driver, you will first need to assume root and set the PATH to
match that used durring the build phase.

	# PATH="$PATH:/opt/csw/bin:/opt/csw/gcc4/bin:/usr/ccs/bin"
	# export PATH
	# gmake install


CONFIGURATION
================
Once installed, you will need to configure /etc/X11/xorg.conf to make X aware
of any attached tablets. The linuxwacom wiki has setup instructions available at
http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/linuxwacom/index.php?title=Configuring_X#Static_xorg.conf_Setup

Under Solaris, USB tablets will appear as HID devices accessible under from
'/dev/usb'. You should be able to determine which HID device is associated
with the tablet by either comparing an 'ls' of the directory before and 
after plugging in the tablet, or by consulting `dmesg | tail`.


UNINSTALLING
===============
To uninstall the driver, you will first need to set the PATH so that any
necessary tools may be found.

	# PATH="$PATH:/opt/csw/bin:/opt/csw/gcc4/bin:/usr/ccs/bin"
	# export PATH
	# gmake uninstall
